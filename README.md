Encounter Jesus Fellowship, or EJ (pronounced “edge”), is a network of Christian fellowships that seeks to help others encounter Jesus with the help of the Holy Spirit through the teaching of His Word, worship and prayer.

It is our hope that we can do more than teach principles about finding purpose and meaning in life, discovering meaningful work, forging relationships, forgiving enemies, and so forth. These are all very important.

But before talking about truths to live by, our sincerest desire is to introduce you to Truth Himself – in the Person of Jesus. Jesus says, “I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” [John 14:6]

Principles without knowing the Person from whom they are derived will leave you with a hollowed out faith.

Through teaching, testimonies, singing and sharing of lives, we want to show Jesus Christ as the most glorious, majestic, brilliant Person we have ever met. Now we hope to introduce you to Him. For more info, email info@hillcc.org.
